What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a new git repository using the git command "git init", a .git directory is created in our current directory, which stores the metadata of the commit history. It isn't tracking any files at this stage, and there haven't been any commits. git by itself doesn't add a commit, since we would like a logical message to be associated with the commit and also since, we might not want to commit all the files. For git to maintain a history of changes, it needs to be initialized in the directory.
